Client-side repo for the Activity Monitor group project. Main project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Ultra-Instinct-js/activity-monitor-main).

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:Ultra-Instinct-js/activity-monitor-client.git`
2. Enter the directory `cd activity-monitor-client`
3. Install dependencies `npm install`
   
* `npm start` to run the client server using [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
* `npm test` to run the tests contained in the `./test` directory.
* `npm run coverage` to check test coverage.
* `npm run dev` to run the client server and watch for JavaScript changes with [`watchify`](https://github.com/browserify/watchify).
* `npm run bundle` to build a JavaScript bundle using [`browserify`](https://github.com/browserify/browserify).

### Deploy

The client side is currently deployed at https://ultra-activity-monitor.netlify.app/

## Project Goal

Build a habit tracking website where users can make an account and create habits for themselves to track and update.

### Other requirements:

* Users should be able to choose the frequency that they want to track the habit.
* Users should be able to see that their habit is complete as well as their most recent completion streak.

## Design & Implementation

The main idea behind the design of the client side was that it should be a single-page web application with dynamically updating content.
